                <h3>About NASA</h3>
                <p>
                    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA /ˈnæsə/)
                    is an independent agency of the US federal government responsible
                    for the civil space program, aeronautics research, and space research.
                </p>

                    NASA was established in 1958, succeeding the National Advisory Committee
                    for Aeronautics (NACA), to give the U.S. space development effort
                    a distinctly civilian orientation, emphasizing peaceful applications
                    in space science.[5][6][7] NASA has since led most American space exploration,
                    including Project Mercury, Project Gemini, the 1968-1972 Apollo Moon landing missions,
                    the Skylab space station, and the Space Shuttle. NASA supports the International
                    Space Station and oversees the development of the Orion spacecraft,
                    the Space Launch System, Commercial Crew vehicles, and the planned
                    Lunar Gateway space station. The agency is also responsible for
                    the Launch Services Program, which provides oversight of launch
                    operations and countdown management for uncrewed NASA launches.

                    NASA's science is focused on better understanding Earth through
                    the Earth Observing System;[8] advancing heliophysics through the
                    efforts of the Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program;
                    exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic spacecraft
                    such as New Horizons and planetary rovers such as Perseverance;
                    and researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big Bang, through the James Webb Space Telescope,
                    and the Great Observatories and associated programs.
